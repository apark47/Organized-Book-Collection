# Organized-Book-Collection
This project uses an ordered linked list to organize book objects by author, year, and 
title into a collection. It also recursively determines if a book currently exists in the
collection and allows users to insert and remove books accordingly. I worked on this project 
for my Intermediate Python class in Spring 2023.
