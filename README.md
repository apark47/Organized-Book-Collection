# Organized-Book-Collection
This project uses an Ordered Linked List to organize book objects by author, year, and 
title, respectively, into a collection. It also recursively determines if a book currently 
exists in the collection and allows users to insert and remove books accordingly. I worked 
on this project for my Intermediate Python class in Spring 2023.
